# Custom sort objects

Order an array of javascript objects according to a key, but rather than using ascending or descending order, specify an order by passing an array of values to be matched, in the relevant order. 

Objects in the array which are not matched are appended to the end of the returned array.

RegExp can also be passed as an order item.
